# Games-Website

The goal of this project is to develop my skills as a software developer and practice using React and Django. I also want to create a fully functioning database to store all game scores and user info.

The theme of the website is games that you could have played at school with a pen and paper or board games where you could play with two players or by yourself. I have chosen this because there are quite a few games like that that i can expand the app with and all a different complexities to build so i can build up my experience over time. 

In the future I would like to add online multiplayer or a game AI to play the games as that would be interesting to learn how to do that and having multiple games like connect 4 or O & X's allows me to do that.

## Home Page

On the home page I want everything to be acccessible to the user from it. So in my mockup i have recreated a home screen of a smart phone with individual app icons for each of the games. at the bottom are buttons that take you to the Leaderboard, Profile and back to the Games home screen. In the future it would be cool to just be able to swipe left and right to switch between theese pages but as i'm creating a web app i will stick to the buttons for now. At the top of the page is the search bar which isn't neccessary at the moment but in the future if there are alot more games on there it will make finding them easier for the user.
